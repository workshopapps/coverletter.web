				Cover letters for every professional scenario
			</h3>
			<p className=" mb-12 text-lg">
				Most people write cover letters for job applications, but that’s
				not their only use. Cover letters can be used in a variety of
				professional situations. Crafting a terrific cover letter can
				help you stand out in several different scenarios, including:
			</p>
			<img src={image3} alt="" className="mx-auto" />
			<h5 className="text-lg font-bold mt-10">Prospecting a company</h5>
			<p className=" mb-6 text-lg">
				{" "}
				A prospecting (or cold contact) cover letter is written by a job
				seeker to acompany of interest. This type of cover letter is a
				general inquiry about open positions rather than a response to a
				specific job ad. This letter is designed to put you on a
				recruiter’s radar so that when an appropriate role opens up,
				you’ll be the first person who comes to mind.
			</p>
			<h5 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Networking cover letter</h5>
			<p className=" mb-6 text-lg">
				Unlike a standard cover letter that’s sent as part of a job
				application, a networking cover letter might be sent to a former
				colleague, mentor, friend, or other professional contacts. This
				type of cover letter informs the recipient you’re looking for a
				job and requests their assistance. A networking cover letter is
				the most casual and tends to be the shortest.
			</p>
			<h5 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Career-change letter</h5>
			<p className=" mb-6 text-lg">
				This type of cover letter can play a big part in proving your
				worth when you’re looking to make a career change. It allows you
				to explain why you want to take on a new title or enter a new
				field and describe how you already possess the necessary
				transferable skills. A career change cover letter lets you draw
				a line between your work experience and the responsibilities
				you’d have in this new role.
			</p>
			<h5 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Relocation cover letter</h5>
			<p className=" mb-12 text-lg">
				If you’re planning to relocate, your cover letter should
				reassure an employer that this is a long-term move and that the
				transition will be smooth. If you’re looking to relocate for the
				sake of the job opportunity, give convincing reasons why you
				would like to make the move, such as a stronger economy or a
				better lifestyle.
