		question: "What’s the difference between a cover letter and a resume?",
		answer: "A resume is a formal summary of your work experience, education, and skills, divided into sections. It shows your career history in a structured way and provides the recruiter with crucial information about your professional background while a cover letter is a detailed document that shows hiring managers your desire for a particular job. It is an opportunity to demonstrate more of your personality than you can on your resume. Throughout the letter, you can discuss specific items listed in the job description and how your skills and experience match those requirements.",
		isOpen: false,
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		question:
			"Do i need a different cover letter for every job application?",
		answer: "Customizing your cover letter for each application doesn't mean you have to create a new cover letter from scratch for every opening. However, the more customized your cover letter is to the job, the better the chance a recruiter will want to continue onto your resume.",
		isOpen: false,
	},
	{
		id: 3,
		question: "How can I make my cover letter stand out?",

		isOpen: false,
	},
	{
		id: 6,
		question: "How should my cover letter complement my resume?",
		answer: "The point of a cover letter is to provide more details about what’s in your resume as well as show the recruiter how motivated you are to join their team. A cover letter should therefore be written based on the jobs, tasks, achievements, and skills that are on your resume.",
		isOpen: false,
	},

		question: "Are cover letters really necessary?",

		isOpen: false,
	},
	{
		id: 9,
		question: "Is it okay to use a cover letter generator?",
		answer: "Yes, it’s okay to use a cover letter generator. Hiring managers aren’t concerned with anything other than the content of your letter (and whether or not it’s easy to read). Our builder handles the formatting, and makes creating content targeted at the specific job you want as easy as a few clicks of your mouse.",
		isOpen: false,
	},
	{
