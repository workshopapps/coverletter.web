		answer: "A resume is a formal summary of your work experience, education, and skills, divided into sections. It shows your career history in a structured way and provides the recruiter with crucial information about your professional background while a cover letter is a detailed document that shows hiring managers your desire for a particular job. It is an opportunity to demonstrate more of your personality than you can on your resume. Throughout the letter, you can discuss specific items listed in the job description and how your skills and experience match those requirements.",
